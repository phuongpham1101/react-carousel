# React Carousel

The carousel is built following this design: https://www.figma.com/file/SmJU0ebqgQXkFcUTs7rRbe/Hero-Carousel-Test?node-id=64%3A3

### Potential improvements:
- For different image ratio, during transition effect may not be consistent (eg. image stretching). A possible solution is to create seperate divs on top of each other instead of toggling the image URL in one div
- Responsive work
- Ability to pause the carousel on hover so the user can have more time to read.
- Hover animation of buttons.
